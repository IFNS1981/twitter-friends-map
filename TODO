//TODO create extremely custom marker objects

Add user input field and button, add input validation

Each marker object should be a circle with a number inside,
when the user hovers over the cirle, the circle either populates with
with user, in the case of one user in one location, or animates out
a larger of circle out from itself holding circular images of each
of the people at the specific location.

Lots of custom JS and CSS for the markers and infowindows

When the person is hovered or clicked we should be able to see their
relevant information, such as 'location', screen name, and link to
their profile.

AJAX callbacks should be based on calling function and not specifically namespaced

Info overlay with containing information
