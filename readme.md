##Twitter Friends Map

View [here](http://theron17.github.com/Twitter-Friends-Map)

Fully client-side map that 'attempts' to find where your twitter followers are located.

It uses 'user-provided' location information and then calls a geo-location service to attempt to place the user on a map.

This is obviously flimsy. Many users don't provide correct information. 

Firefox is located on 'the internet' according to their twitter profile.

So Firefox ends up showing near Africa, probably at 0,0 Lat,Long.

Without a user providing coordinates or much more processing time, say to get the last few tweets for each user and attempt to base a location on whether a tweet has a geolocation attached.

But... it's fun to see where users are if they actually have provided the correct information, just don't assume it to be correct.

Enjoy :)
